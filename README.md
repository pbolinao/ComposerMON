INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY LOCALLY:

1) To start the localhost server open the './api/v1' folder in the command line and run 'npm start'

2) Import the 'M4finalProject.sql' file into XAMPP to setup the database.

3) Open 'index.html' from the './web/public' folder to run the application

4) A name must be entered in order to create or join a room

5) In order to play with yourself the webapp should be opened on different web browsers (ie Google Chrome and Firefox)
	-Because some data is stored in localStorage and may intertwine if both clients are on the same web browser
	-Using incognito mode might work aswell
